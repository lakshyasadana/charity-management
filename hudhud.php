    <h2>Why the cyclonic storm is called Hudhud?</h2><br>

        <p>The name for the storm HUDHUD is contributed by Oman. It is an Arabic word. It is Hoope Bird which is called Hudhud in Arabic.</p><br>
    <p>Extreme severe cycllonic storm HUDHUD, was a strong tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage and loss of life in eastern India and Nepal during October 2014.

        Hudhud originated from a low pressure system that formed under the influence of an upper-air cyclonic circulation in the Andaman Sea on October 6.
        Hudhud intensified into a cyclonic storm on October 8 and as a Severe Cyclonic Storm on October 9.
        Hudhud underwent rapid deepening in the following days and was classified as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm by the IMD.
        Shortly before landfall near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, on October 12, Hudhud reached its peak strength with three-minute wind speeds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 960 mbar (28.35 inHg).
        The system then drifted northwards towards Uttar Pradesh and Nepal, causing widespread rains in both areas and heavy snowfall in the latter.</p><br>

       <p> Hudhud caused extensive damage to the city of Visakhapatnam and the neighbouring districts of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam of Andhra Pradesh.
        Damages were estimated to be ₹21,908 crore (US$3.4 billion) by the Andhra state government.[3] At least 124 deaths have been confirmed, a majority of them from Andhra Pradesh and Nepal, with the latter experiencing an avalanche due to the cyclone.</p><br>
    <p>On 12 Oct 2014, Tropical Cyclone Hudhud made landfall on India's coast of Andhra Pradesh, near the city of Visakhapatnam, as a category 3 storm.
        Visakhapatnam was heavily damaged, including the airport, a number of buildings, electrical and telecommunications supplies and roads.
        Similarly, districts of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Vijayanagaram sustained damage to infrastructure, communication, shelter and livelihoods.
        Light ‘kutcha’ houses (mud and/or thach) were particularly badly damaged.
        According to media and government reporting, 22 people were killed and over 248,00 people in 320 villages were affected. </p><br><br>
